### Want to win?

Ultimately, the task is to get code from the language we made up, `chal`, to run.

> You may use any language that will compile via github actions. The due date will be 6/20 @ 11:59 PST. Submit by adding `SwipeX` to your private github repo and DM'ing Swipe the link to your repo (for association).

This will be broken up into 3 main components, there may be other ways to achieve this, however the following methodology **will be required**.

### Parser

This component will take the text, along with the language syntax definition, and form a medium that can be translated into an AST.

### Abstract Syntax Tree

For those who are not familiar, [refer here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). You will design and create your own AST from the medium you created in the first step. 

### Processor

The job of the processor is to execute the AST.


## Sample Code

In order to reduce confusion, we are providing 5 code samples. If your project can correctly run all of these, you can consider it complete.

### Recursion

### Math/Unary/Binary

### String

### Error

### Functions & Vars
